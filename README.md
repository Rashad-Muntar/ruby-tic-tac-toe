### Project Goal

The aim of this project is to implement the Tic Tac Toe Game using Ruby as [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop) specifies.


### Project Achieved
* Project folder setup: Two folders were created namely "lib", "bin" and an executable main.rb file was created.
* user interface displaying the mock of the basic flow of the game added
* User interface with game logic and results added. Game is now playable from the console.
* Milestones achieved will be updated as project progresses

# Tic Tac Toe
This is a collaborative project to test our understanding of the [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
Tic Tac Toe (X O) terminal game implementation using Ruby.

## How to Play

Board is divided into a grid of 9 cells

1. Each player enters their name.
2. Plyaers choose their tool either X or O.
3. Each player chooses an empty cell to mark in their turn.
4. The first player to mark a row, column or diagonal wins.
5. If the grid is full with no winning conditions the game ends with a draw!
6. You can play another match in which case the game will count your score.
7. Otherwise, the game will end and the code will terminate.
